    "Here, we will improve the previously developed “News Article Summarizer” script. The goal is to improve its accuracy in extracting and presenting key information from long news articles in a bulleted list format.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we will adapt our current summarizer to prompt the underlying language model to produce summaries as bulleted lists using output parsers. This requires specific adjustments to the framing of our prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a recap of what we did and what we are going to do in this project:\n",

    "*Pipeline for our news articles summarizer with scraping, parsing, prompting, and generation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the article summarizer, we employ few-shot learning to show the model how the output should be structured in advance, helping it adapt to the desired format. We also pass the output generated by the model through output parsers to ensure that the structure of the output adheres to the desired format.\n",
    "\n",
    "This entire process, leveraging **few-shot learning** for accuracy and output parsers for format control, ensures a high-quality, structured summarization of the news articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial phases of this process are technically identical to [part 1](./build-a-news-articles-summarizer.ipynb).\n"
