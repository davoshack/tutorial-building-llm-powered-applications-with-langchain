After the transcription is complete, the text is summarized using LangChain, employing three different approaches: *stuff*, *refine*, and *map_reduce*. Finally, multiple transcriptions are added to the DeepLake database to enable question-answering for those videos.\n",

    "The tutorial teaches how to programmatically summarize a video featuring Yann LeCun, a notable computer scientist and AI researcher. The video covers LeCun’s thoughts on the challenges associated with large language models. However, the code would work with any other video as long as it can be summarized using only its audio (as the model won’t know what is shown in the video) and that ideally contains only a few speakers. Video podcasts are ideal for this project.\n",
