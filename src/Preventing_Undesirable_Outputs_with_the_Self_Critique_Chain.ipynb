    "# Tutorial 4: Preventing Undesirable Outputs with the Self-Critique Chain\n",

    "In a production setting, it is crucial to implement a system that ensures the responses generated by large language models (LLMs) are appropriate, avoiding outputs that may be harmful or misleading. Fortunately, these advanced models can self-correct, provided they are prompted correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LangChain self-critique chain acts as a regulatory mechanism, reviewing the model’s output to ascertain whether it meets set expectations. In cases of non-compliance, the model is prompted to adjust its responses according to the application’s specific requirements. For instance, in a student mentoring context, this system ensures that the model promotes ethical behavior, like encouraging hard work over unethical shortcuts to achieve high academic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate how the self-critique chain works, let’s begin with an example of a response we aim to avoid. We use the ***GPT-3.5 model (gpt-3.5-turbo)*** and create a prompt for an assistant who advises students based on their goals. The `LLMChain` class is then utilized to link the model and the prompt, enabling the retrieval of the model’s response through the `.run()` method.\n",

    "**The Constitutional Principle** class accepts three parameters: ***name***, ***critique***, and ***revision***. The name  parameter simply gives a name to the created principle so that we can later easily distinguish it from other principles. The critique parameter establishes the expectations from the model, and the revision parameter identifies the steps to be taken if these expectations are not fulfilled in the model’s initial output. The example aims for an ethical response, anticipating the class will prompt a rewriting request to the model with predetermined values. The `ConstitutionalChain` class consolidates these components, and the verbose argument is used to observe the model’s generation process.\n",

    "The use of `ConstitutionalChain` is effective in preventing inappropriate responses, especially in customer service bots. This method ensures the model adheres to its guidelines, regardless of the user’s initial prompt. In a production environment, this approach is very important to maintain the integrity of the model’s responses, safeguarding against various user-initiated prompt attacks. In the code above, we applied a new principle, ensuring the result is entertaining and understandable to a 7th grader. This `fun_principle` can be incorporated into the array passed to the `constitutional_principles` parameter. The sequence in which these checks are applied is always the same. In this instance, the code first verifies that the output is ethical before assessing if it’s humorous."
