    "In a production setting, it is crucial to implement a system that ensures the responses generated by large language models (LLMs) are appropriate, avoiding outputs that may be harmful or misleading. Fortunately, these advanced models can self-correct, provided they are prompted correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LangChain self-critique chain acts as a regulatory mechanism, reviewing the model’s output to ascertain whether it meets set expectations. In cases of non-compliance, the model is prompted to adjust its responses according to the application’s specific requirements. For instance, in a student mentoring context, this system ensures that the model promotes ethical behavior, like encouraging hard work over unethical shortcuts to achieve high academic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate how the self-critique chain works, let’s begin with an example of a response we aim to avoid. We use the ***GPT-3.5 model (gpt-3.5-turbo)*** and create a prompt for an assistant who advises students based on their goals. The `LLMChain` class is then utilized to link the model and the prompt, enabling the retrieval of the model’s response through the `.run()` method.\n",

    ">Before executing the upcoming code, ensure your OpenAI key is set in the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable and install the necessary packages using this command: !pip install langchain==0.0.208 deeplake openai==0.27.8 tiktoken."
