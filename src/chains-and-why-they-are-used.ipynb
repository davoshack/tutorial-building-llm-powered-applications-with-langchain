    "# What are LangChain Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "In LangChain, chains facilitate the creation of end-to-end RAG pipelines. They integrate various components into a user-friendly interface, including the model, prompt, memory, output parsing, and debugging capabilities. A chain does the following: 1) receives the user’s query as input, 2) processes the LLM’s response, and 3) returns the output to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "To design a custom pipeline, one can extend the Chain class. An example is the LLMChain, which represents the most basic chain type in LangChain and inherits from the Chain parent class."

The following code snippet uses the GPT-3 model via the OpenAI API. It employs the PromptTemplate feature from LangChain and unifies the process using the LLMChain class."
