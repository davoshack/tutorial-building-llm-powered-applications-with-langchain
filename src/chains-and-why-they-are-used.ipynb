    "# What are LangChain Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "In LangChain, chains facilitate the creation of end-to-end RAG pipelines. They integrate various components into a user-friendly interface, including the model, prompt, memory, output parsing, and debugging capabilities. A chain does the following: 1) receives the user’s query as input, 2) processes the LLM’s response, and 3) returns the output to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "To design a custom pipeline, one can extend the Chain class. An example is the LLMChain, which represents the most basic chain type in LangChain and inherits from the Chain parent class."
